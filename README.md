# ExpresswayScenarioInterface

Driving scenarios for the NADS MiniSim take months to produce which is a major portion of driving research studies. This software was created in order to help the Driver Interface Group at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute build and test expressway scenarios in a quick and correct manner. The program consists of three major portions:

- reading and writing scenario files
- a graphical interface useful to the researcher
- functions to translate the user input and rewrite the scenario file

## Use

(Zip)

1. Download the zip file from /exec

2. Unzip the files to a folder on your system

3. Install MSVC 2015

4. Run the application. Load in the *base.scn*

5. Make changes. Save the new *.scn* file.

6. Load into Minisim or ISAT
