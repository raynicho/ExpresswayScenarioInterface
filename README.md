# ExpresswayScenarioInterface

Driving scenarios for the NADS MiniSim take months to produce and take up a major portion of driving research studies. This software was created in order to help the Driver Interface Group at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute build and test expressway scenarios in a quick and correct manner. The program consists of three major portions:

#Reading .scn Files
.scn files are used to represent driving scenarios and contain all scenario information besides the geometric markup. This includes but is not limited to the following:

- Simple Scenario Information (Weather, Starting Location, Subject Driver's Vehicle)
- Vehicles
- Traffic Lights
- Activation Triggers

These files are .txt files at their root and follow a format in order for the MiniSim and scenario modification tool ISAT to read and/or write information abou the scenarios. The first step in creating expressway scenarios quickly is reading and interpretting what the files already contain.
